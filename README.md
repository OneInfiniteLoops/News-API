## Note

Please note that you will need to access your own environment variables before you can connect to the two local databases. You can do this by creating two .env. files, .env.test and .env.development. Once the files are created, set PGDATABASE=<database_name_here> to the corresponding databases respectively. For example, write PGDATABASE=<database_name_test> for the .env.test file.
